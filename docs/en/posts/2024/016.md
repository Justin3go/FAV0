# Issue 016 -- A-Share Market Surge

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/fav0-016-cover.jpg)

Photos from my trip to Western Sichuan during the Mid-Autumn Festival; I feel I have enough images to last me several issues~

> This weekly publication is [open source](https://github.com/Justin3go/FAV0), documenting my observations and experiences, primarily focusing on front-end development, AI, independent development, open-source tools, etc. It is published every Saturday/weekend. Contributions are welcome, and I look forward to your [follow/subscribe](https://fav0.com/feed.xml)~

**The Surge in A-Shares: Talking About My Investment Mindset**

I’m not very good at investing, and I don’t understand financial reports or analyses of company operations. Therefore, I mostly invest in index funds, so I don’t have to worry too much about individual stocks, and I can just check my returns each evening without constantly monitoring the markets.

Regarding my strategy:

- When to buy? I don’t like chasing prices because I always feel that I’m buying in at too high a price. Thus, I generally buy more as prices drop.
- When to sell? This is more casual; as long as I’ve made a profit, I sell based on my mood. For instance, if I want to buy some additional consumer goods, I might sell some shares.

My mindset:

No matter how much the market drops, it doesn’t really affect my mood because:

1. I know I’m a long-term holder; short-term fluctuations are not important to me.
2. I trust the development of the country since I invest in index funds, so I’m not too worried.
3. I only invest a portion of my money, so even if I incur losses, it won’t affect my normal life.

> A phrase I really like: Investing is about making friends with time, not gambling against others at the table~

### [ByteDance's “Sora” Model Release](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1838537643480748408)

The model has three breakthroughs:

- Multi-agent, multi-action interaction, unlocking interaction capabilities between multiple subjects; it’s no longer a one-person show.
- Consistent camera switching, showcasing a storyline told through various consistent shots within a 10-second video, enhancing the narrative feel.
- Powerful cinematography and dynamics, supporting zoom, orbit, pan, dolly, and target tracking, all generated smoothly in one go.
- Multiple style and size options, supporting various styles including black and white, 3D animation, 2D animation, traditional Chinese painting, and thick painting, with sizes 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, 9:16, 21:9, allowing for more creative freedom.

### [OpenAI to Become a For-Profit Company](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/)

I have learned that OpenAI is planning to restructure its core business as a for-profit social enterprise, which will no longer be under the control of its non-profit board. This transition aims to attract more investors while allowing CEO Sam Altman to finally gain equity in the company. Although the non-profit organization will still exist and hold a minority stake in the for-profit entity, this new structure may impact how OpenAI governs its AI risk management practices.

Since its founding in 2015, OpenAI has evolved from an initial non-profit research entity into a company valued at $150 billion, particularly drawing global attention and investments after the launch of ChatGPT. While this structural change might make OpenAI's operations resemble those of a typical startup, it has raised concerns about whether it still has sufficient governance capacity in its pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

With management changes, including the departure of Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, OpenAI's future direction is still under discussion among lawyers and shareholders, and the specific implementation timeline remains uncertain. This move will bring OpenAI's governance structure closer to that of its competitors, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI, both of which are registered as for-profit enterprises aimed at promoting social responsibility.

### [The Frontend Treadmill](https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/)

The author believes that the rapid obsolescence of frontend frameworks is the norm, and debating which framework to use is a waste of time. Regardless of the chosen framework, it may well be outdated in five years. Instead, smart product teams should deeply understand the current frameworks, learn the tools, and avoid being enchanted by the illusion of new tools.
