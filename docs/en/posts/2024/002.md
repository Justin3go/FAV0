**How to maintain the motivation for indie development?**

This week, I came across an [article](https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/) discussing how to maintain the motivation for indie development. Previously, I briefly talked about the four basic motivations of human beings as described by the Indian philosopher Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

1. Fear: Driven by "fear of disease, poverty, hell, or death."
2. Desire: Seeking personal satisfaction through success, wealth, and happiness.
3. Responsibility: Driven by gratitude, duty, and the willingness to do the right thing.
4. Love: Driven by the impulse to care for and help others.

However, these are too general. To keep moving forward, we need a constant source of motivation. One of my favorite sayings is, "Winning lies in execution, and the value lies in persistence." Both the initial motivation to execute and the sustained motivation to persist are crucial, but obtaining a constant source of motivation is very challenging.

In indie development, besides having to develop, maintain, and market your product all by yourself, it's even more important to maintain the corresponding motivation, which is often more difficult than working a job. The aforementioned article shares some very practical points on how to maintain motivation:

1. External motivation: Notifications of subscriptions, notifications of paid conversions;
2. Leaving unfinished tasks to quickly complete the next morning for a quick win, which can maintain motivation for the day;
3. Using your own product as much as possible;
4. Fixing the bad parts instead of enduring them. Unlike in a company, you have full control and don’t need to endure things; complete them as you envision;
5. Doing nothing and sitting down to think for a while;
6. Reviewing progress and summarizing, like writing a weekly journal, which is a form of review;
7. Finding like-minded partners;
8. Avoiding the guilt of idleness;

Of course, some sources of motivation are not recommended for frequent use, such as fear. Overstimulation can be harmful; it’s more like a stress response, and too much stimulation can easily break you down, making you a machine driven by fear, losing that indefinable creativity.

**[Receiving an AI-generated email from a friend?](https://mrgan.com/ai-email-from-a-friend/)**

Using AI to polish some wording is no longer a novelty, but how would you feel if you discovered the person you're chatting with isn't your friend but AI answering on their behalf?

For me:

- If a new friend sends an AI-polished email, I wouldn’t mind as long as the email content is clear. Of course, the premise is that the email was reviewed by them.
- If it’s an old friend, an AI-generated email would make me feel disoriented. AI would erase the personal characteristics I recognize in them, like their usual mannerisms, making it feel like the email is from a stranger.

### [Chrome Browser Now Has Built-in AI Models](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in?hl=zh-cn)

The obvious advantage of local AI models over online ones is locality. Running something locally in the browser has many benefits, just like [`tensorflow.js`](https://www.tensorflow.org/js?hl=zh-cn), which allows running APIs like face recognition locally in the browser. Specifically, the advantages include:

- Reducing network transmission and improving response speed;
- Reducing server pressure;
- Protecting user privacy in certain situations.

In short, it’s very promising!

### ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity Went Down

Perplexity relies on OpenAI. When OpenAI's services went down, it’s understandable that Perplexity couldn’t be used. However, it’s interesting that Claude also went down at the same time.

Large language models are gradually becoming a foundational infrastructure for applications. We can foresee that almost all applications will integrate AI capabilities in the future. Most applications do not have the capability to develop, deploy, and maintain a large language model on their own, and many rely on APIs from a few leading companies. If such a situation occurs, many applications’ AI capabilities will be unavailable, which is quite terrifying.

### [Awesome Cheat Sheets for Various Languages and Frameworks](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets)

I found a project with 38k stars on GitHub that includes cheat sheets for JS, Node, HTML, Django, Bash, Redis, Docker, K8S, Bash, Vim, and more!

Each type contains a single file with the essential APIs you need to know. The framework APIs might be slightly outdated, but the language APIs are still worth a look. They are well-organized and great for review before interviews or for consolidating into your own notes.

### Tips for Handling Sports Injuries

Sharing my experiences of recovering from three sports-related ankle sprains.

- The first time, I didn’t know how to handle it, so I bought Yunnan Baiyao and sprayed it. As a result, it took more than a month to fully recover!
- The second and third times, I immediately applied ice to the injury, and after 24 hours, applied heat. I recovered in a week.

When you’re tired, stop exercising. When you’re not focused, your movements are more likely to be off during confrontations, such as dragging your feet, which can lead to sprains.

Finally, strengthen your muscles!
