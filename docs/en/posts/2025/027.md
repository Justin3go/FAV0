## \>\>Topics to Discuss

**The Impatient AI Programming**

It seems that in recent months, I can no longer calm down and delve into one technology. The focus has shifted to producing results quickly, and it's been ages since I last tackled a technical book over 600 pages long.

If the result of AI coding meets expectations, I'm less concerned whether the underlying principles are correct.

I feel a bit restless, yet as an indie developer, it seems that's how it should be. It's truly a dilemma.

### [TikTok Refugees](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-preparing-us-shut-off-sunday-information-reports-2025-01-15/)

Since TikTok announced its ban, many international users have flocked to Xiaohongshu. This has created numerous indie development opportunities, such as navigation sites, tools for generating Chinese names, and some sites whose purposes I couldnâ€™t comprehend. Sites related to `rednote` have proliferated like locusts, generating significant traffic for some.

In addition, the Xiaohongshu community has become extraordinarily lively, fostering friendly and interesting exchanges between Chinese and international users.
