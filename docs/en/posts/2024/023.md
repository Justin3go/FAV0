**Some Random Thoughts**

Lately, I've been feeling a bit off. In the past, it felt like there were so many things I wanted to do (including working on projects, learning new technologies, playing games, watching movies, playing sports, etc.), that time never seemed enough. So generally, I would wake up early on Saturdays and Sundays because I had something on my mind, a motivation that would eagerly get me out of bed—be it to play games or to code.

But over the past two weeks, I haven't really felt like getting up early, even though I’m already awake... (I’m not sleep-deprived, as I've had a full 7 hours of sleep; I just don't feel like getting up to do anything).

Analyzed two reasons for this:

1. Two friends with whom I regularly played sports have left the city, and the sessions we used to have weekly have slowly disappeared.
2. Recently, my interactions with the outside world have decreased, such as fewer posts and less overall communication, which means less feedback, whether it's positive or negative. This has left me with a sense of stagnation.
3. Supplement to the second point: It's a vicious cycle—less input and output -> less feedback -> no motivation -> even less input and output.

Of course, it might also just be that winter has come, making it harder to get out of bed, overwhelming any so-called motivation.

### [Claude MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)

This post provides deep insights into Claude MCP. Here’s a brief excerpt, [original link](https://x.com/idoubicc/status/1861620206453563446):

> It can be simply understood as being the same thing supported by big models in Function Calling, designed to allow big models to call external services and access more data and capabilities as supplementary context to answer user inquiries;
>
> The distinction lies in that Function Calling involves big models making HTTP requests to third-party API plugins, while MCP entails big models making RPC requests to third-party services;
>
> Function Calling is simpler; third parties merely need to write an API and configure the model to request parameters. Conversely, MCP is more complex: third parties need to write a service implementing RPC methods defined in the protocol, configure the service address and parameters in the model, and the model client needs to perform service discovery once at startup before making calls during dialogue;
>
> The core and challenge of both Function Calling and MCP is in intent recognition on the model side—identifying the matching plugins for random user inquiries, a problem the MCP protocol doesn't solve.
>
> MCP's highlight is its standardized and comprehensive protocol, offering significant guidance for ecosystem collaboration between models and applications. The adoption of MCP hinges on how many third-party services are willing to develop RPC services based on this protocol.
>
> Currently, MCP does not support Remote Server, implying it can only be used in the Claude desktop version.
