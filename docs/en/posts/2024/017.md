## \>\> Topics to Discuss

**Computers are Just Tools**

Recently, with the awarding of the 2024 Nobel Prize, it has sparked a lot of discussion online, as the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the father of artificial intelligence, Geoffrey Hinton, highlighting that a prize in the field of physics was given in relation to artificial intelligence in the computer field; in addition, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was also awarded for contributions to AI.

Now, computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and many people from other fields have some knowledge of computer-related technologies, such as Python and front-end skills. With the development of AI, individuals from other fields can quickly reach a relatively high level of competence in using computer technology. For instance, the now-popular Cursor and Bolt editors helped a non-technical person rapidly develop a website in just two hours.

Conversely, if we are professionals in the computer field yet only understand computer-related concepts, our competitive edge will diminish. This era seems to increasingly require talent that crosses fields, such as computer science + physics, computer science + psychology, etc. It is similar to how we should understand business while working in a company; only by grasping another domain can we truly leverage the role of computing within that field.

This is also why many independent developers continue developing the same three applications (to-do lists, budgeting tools, note-taking apps) — because many individuals have limited understanding of other domains and only focus on development-related tools, such as creating a tool site or an information aggregation platform. They find it challenging to identify the needs of other areas, which naturally leads to a lack of innovative development.
