# Issue 006 -- Independent Development Will Always Have Similar Products

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/fav0-006-cover.jpg)

This Saturday’s "Legend of Mortal Cultivation" was quite enjoyable. I noticed many people in the comments were saying "Life is like a game of chess, every move counts."

## \>\> Topics to Discuss

**Independent Development Will Always Have Similar Products**

Recently, Jiguang Cards have been imitated and copied by Liuguang Cards. Moreover, the author of Liuguang Cards has been maliciously directing traffic to their product in the comment section of Jiguang Cards. This incident has sparked a lot of opinions online, with some supporting and others opposing it, alongside various discussions.

Here, I won’t delve into my views on malicious traffic diversion, but rather discuss how there will always be countless competing products for the same type of product, especially with the increasing number of independent developers in recent years. The competing products mentioned here refer to those with the same primary goal but might differ in form, not a one-to-one perfect replica.

These different products of the same type often carry a unique "characteristic" of their respective authors, such as:

- Author A likes to place function A in the primary menu and function B in the secondary menu.
- Author B likes to place function B in the primary menu and function A in the secondary menu.

For instance (in the early stages of a project):

- Author A values performance, with simple pages but always fast response times.
- Author B values interaction, with excellent page interactions but slight lag.

And another example (in the early stages of a project):

- Author A likes to integrate functions together for one-click use.
- Author B prefers to manage functions by categories, allowing users more flexible configurations.

And so on...

Different independent developers make different trade-offs, resulting in varied choices and ultimately, different products with the same type of functionality but different forms, attracting users with different "characteristics."

There are so many users, each with their own preferences. Independent development mostly targets niche users, making it difficult to create a large, comprehensive product. Serving the target user base well is sufficient.

At the same time, many independent developers realize halfway through their development that there are already many excellent similar products on the market, leading to self-doubt and eventually giving up. I believe this is unnecessary. We can discover our own "characteristics" and incorporate them into our products to attract users with matching "characteristics."

The phrase "Everyone has their unique talent" can also be applied to a product. We should believe that the product we meticulously crafted is unique. Of course, pure "self-indulgence" is also undesirable, and communication with target users is very important, which I won’t elaborate on here.

I tried out the MarsCode plugin in VSCode, and here’s my experience:

Pros:

- The code completion capability meets my needs.
- It’s free, responsive, and doesn’t have the downtime issues like Copilot.

Cons:

- Poor integration with VSCode, with no theme adaptation or inline code conversations.
- Markdown completion is erratic and almost unusable:

The Japanese player and the Chinese team coach tried to check his condition immediately but were stopped by the referee. He was sent to the hospital but passed away at 23:20 on the same day due to unsuccessful resuscitation.

Only 17 years old, it’s such a pity for such an outstanding new star in Chinese badminton.

### [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag)

[Related Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-new-tool-for-complex-data-discovery-now-on-github/)

GraphRAG uses a large language model (LLM) to automatically extract rich knowledge graphs from any collection of text documents.

One of the most exciting features of this graph-based data index is its ability to report the semantic structure of the data before any user query. It achieves this by detecting closely connected nodes in "communities" hierarchically, partitioning the graph at multiple levels from high-level to low-level topics.

As shown in Figure 1, it uses LLM to summarize each community, creating hierarchical summaries of the data, providing an overview of the dataset without knowing what questions to ask in advance. Each community serves as the basis for community summaries, describing its entities and their relationships.
