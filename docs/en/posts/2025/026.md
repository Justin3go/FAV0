**Marketing and Sales**

In indie development, the code is often the easy part; what's difficult is marketing and sales. Recently, I watched [Li Ziran's Overseas Market Growth Practical Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAmYYzStt8k), and one point that impressed me was: [You need to tell a good story about your product right from the start.]

1. Good story: Users trust you more, and when it's time for secondary dissemination, bloggers can refer to your story for promotion; otherwise, they wouldn't know how to write the content.
2. From the start: The internet has memories. A product can iterate, but once a story is captured and indexed by other sites, it's hard to modify it.

Here are some other points:

1. Product Hunt: If you want to drive traffic, post between Tuesday and Thursday. If you want to rush the daily chart, post on Sunday when it's relatively less competitive. For weekly or monthly charts, post at the beginning of the week or month.
2. Product Hunt is a good way to verify secondary dissemination; tech media and influencers focus on the products there. A ratio above two indicates good secondary dissemination.
3. SEO is the most reliable and important strategy. Focus on building backlinks first and then content. Once you have basic authority, devote your energy to content creation. Your website should also have a sharing mechanism.
4. Google's aim is for your website to solve users' problems, not necessarily to keep them there longer. A critical metric is whether your site is the final stop for users' search queries.
5. Besides having a few curated articles to tell the story of your site, you also need a lot of medium-quality articles to cover your site's keywords. Ensure articles are indexed and manually submit them if needed.
6. AI-generated content might be discriminated against.
7. PSEO (program-generated content) is permissible but should help users.

The video is full of valuable insights, so I recommend watching the full video.

Additionally, there's a discussion on this week's Hacker News about [how indie entrepreneurs learn marketing and sales](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42557947), where many Hackers share their experiences and advice, such as:

- Networks (friends of friends, customers' friends, etc.)
- "Long game" (SEO, word-of-mouth, etc.)
- Finding customers is hard. You need to get close to them, understand their pain points.
- "The Sales for Founders" book is a great resource
- "Start marketing from day one of coding"

### [In Praise of the Hundred-Page Idea](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/17/in-praise-of-the-hundred-page-idea/)

I prefer a light non-fiction book to a detailed tome. As an amateur in many interests, my attention span for any specific topic is more likely to sustain for 100 pages than 600. The ideal length is longer than a long-form internet article but doesnâ€™t require a month-long commitment: a 2-3 hour read.
