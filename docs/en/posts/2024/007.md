# Issue 007 -- Surviving the AI Era

Back from the business trip! Returned to Chongqing, and here's a fresh photo from today.
## \>\> Topics to Discuss

**Robots Threatening Drivers' Livelihoods**

Recently, Baidu's autonomous driving service, "Apollo Go," has been extensively tested in Wuhan, threatening the livelihoods of many Didi drivers.

As times change, it's certain that more and more people will find their jobs threatened. Looking back:

- In the past, it was human-powered rickshaws
- Now it's electric/petrol-powered cars

In the past, humans figured out how to write and drive; now it's AI-driven writing and driving...

New inventions always lead to a group of people being left behind. Without discussing the issues related to drivers, let's talk about the programmer industry: how do we avoid being left behind?

It's the same old advice: continuous learning, maintaining creativity, leveraging AI, etc. My summary is simple: just outwork others ðŸ¤£. Take it one step at a time, deal with challenges as they come.

It's like running out of a danger zone: AI/machines are the danger zone. Staying in it too long will definitely get you eliminated, so we humans need to stay inside the danger zone or keep moving within it before being eliminated. Of course, the danger zone will also shrink as times progress.

### [A Very Nice Light Theme for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fisheva.Eva-Theme)

I'm currently leaning towards light themes, and this theme's colors are great. The background is silver-gray, not as harsh as pure white, and other variables' colors look nice too, with keywords in bold.

I've been using it for over two years, almost without any unadapted areas. There was a minor issue with Jupyter, but it was quickly fixed after I reported it.

### [Solutions for Server-Initiated Notifications](https://rxdb.info/articles/websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html)

For modern real-time web applications, the ability to send events from the server to the client is essential.

- **Long Polling**: Keeps the connection open until new data is available, reducing network traffic and server load but introduces communication delays.
- **WebSockets**: Provides full-duplex communication, suitable for low-latency and high-frequency updates, but more complex to implement.
- **SSE** (Server-Sent Events): One-way communication, suitable for real-time client updates without requiring client data.
- **WebTransport**: Based on HTTP/3 and QUIC protocols, provides efficient data transfer but is not widely supported yet.
- **WebRTC**: Supports peer-to-peer communication between browsers and mobile apps, suitable for streaming audio, video, and data exchange, mainly for client-to-client interactions.
