# Issue 011 -- Slacking Off

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/fav0-011-cover.jpg)

A nice Chongqing hotpot place, with a mild level of spiciness.
## \>\> Topics to Discuss

I haven't had much to think about this week (a bit, no).

Yes, I've been slacking off on writing the weekly newsletter. I thought about it and realized that the first section, [What I Want to Talk About], was holding me back. However, I concluded that there’s no need to bind myself with constraints. Although I don’t have much to discuss this week, I am still keeping an eye on some things and have noted them down. There are still plenty of topics to write about in other sections. Therefore, the structure of the FAV0 newsletter should be more flexible.
