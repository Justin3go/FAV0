**Do You Use Follow Lists on Social Media?**

Recently, I've been experimenting with using "Follow Lists" instead of "Recommended Lists." I find that I prefer "Recommended Lists" for the following reasons:

- Follow Lists, like RSS feeds, emails, and unread messages, feel like tasks that need processing and can put pressure on me;
- Meanwhile, Recommended Lists hold an element of surprise, sparking curiosity and eagerness to read further.

(If the goal is entertainment, I prefer it to be pressure-free. ðŸ˜†)
