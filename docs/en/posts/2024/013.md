**Think and Grow Rich**

This week I read the book [“Think and Grow Rich”](https://weread.qq.com/web/reader/7d032b0059887a7d0bb9d2a#outline?noScroll=1), and here’s a quote image:

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/Pasted%20image%2020240901220501.png)
Below is a recommendation written by someone else for this book:

> In life, one should connect with positive people and think about positive things. Although no one can avoid encountering bad people and bad situations, we still need to learn to think about beautiful things and deliberately seek out those who can influence us, making us think and act for ourselves, and associate with them. They will not only not disappoint us but will also fill our minds with good people, good deeds, and beautiful dreams. Because belief is the main catalyst for thought. When belief and thought waves combine, the subconscious immediately receives the shock wave of their combination and transforms it into products equivalent to spirit, thus generating infinite wisdom. For instance, when we often think about how to become wealthy, the information our minds receive may contain many tips for wealth creation.
> 
> Capital does not simply refer to money; it more often refers to well-organized, intellectually superior groups whose members are adept at devising effective plans and methods for utilizing money for public and self-interest.
> 
> The only thing a person can absolutely control is their own thoughts. This is the most meaningful and inspiring aspect of all known matters to humanity, reflecting the sacred privilege that humans enjoy. This sacred privilege is the only way to control one’s destiny. If one cannot master their own thoughts, they certainly cannot control anything else.
> 
> Thought control is the result of self-discipline and habits. If we do not control our thoughts, they will control us in return. The two are uncompromising. The most practical way to control thoughts is to keep them busy, focusing on implementing action plans towards established goals.
> 
> Life is like a game of chess, and the opponent is time! If we are indecisive or negligent in changing our strategies, our pieces will be consumed by time, as time will not tolerate any hesitation.
> 
> This book, “Think and Grow Rich,” is a culmination of 25 years of work by Napoleon Hill, who interviewed over 500 business and political leaders and summarized a complete set of secrets to wealth and philosophy of success. It has guided countless ordinary people to practice the principles and laws in the book and achieve great success, turning many into millionaires. It is worth reading!

In summary, I've read it once so far (the book suggests reading it more than three times), and the reading process allows one to re-recognize oneself. For example, it discusses the role of belief, the intensity of desire, the powerful forces of sex and love, even extending to the concept of marriage, as well as the role of the subconscious, and so on. This feeling is quite pleasant.

The outline of the book is as follows:

1. Desire: The starting point of all achievements
2. Desire: Imagine success and believe in the realization of dreams
3. Self-suggestion: A medium influencing the subconscious
4. Specialized knowledge: Personal experience and insights
5. Imagination: The factory of human wisdom
6. Organized planning: The specific process of turning desire into action
7. Decision: Overcoming the bad habits of procrastination and laziness
8. Persistence: The unwavering belief in success
9. The power of the mastermind: The principle of achieving more with less effort
10. The mystery of transforming physiological desires: The law of mind-body balance
11. Subconscious thinking: The path to infinite wisdom
12. The brain: The broadcasting and receiving station of thought
13. The sixth sense: The gateway to wisdom

As for the ideas in it, most are quite classic and have been seen in various places to some extent, but this book presents them in a way that is more convincing, perhaps because it provides numerous examples.

### [Telegram Arrested by French Authorities](https://x.com/telegram/status/1827787345367834772)

I won’t elaborate on this, but I want to mention a recent blog I read - [Is Telegram Really an Encrypted App?](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/), key point:

> **Telegram does not have end-to-end encryption enabled by default**; users need to manually activate the "Secret Chat" feature, which is only applicable to one-on-one conversations. The author points out that this means most Telegram conversations, including all group chats, could potentially be viewed by Telegram's servers.

### Notion to Delete Data of Russian Users

On September 9, Notion will delete all data of Russian users due to new U.S. sanctions.

So now I prefer to manage my own data:

- Local first
- Self-hosted open-source repositories
- Can export in universal formats

### [Insights on Self-Media Covers and Titles](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1829141115460800841)

Covers are for people to see, while titles are mainly for machines to read.

### [Linux Pipes Are Slow](https://qsantos.fr/2024/08/25/linux-pipes-are-slow/)

Writing to pipes is ten times slower than writing to raw memory. This is because writing to a pipe requires us to spend a lot of time acquiring locks, and we cannot effectively use vector instructions.

In principle, we can move data at a speed of 167 GB/s, but we need to avoid the costs of locking buffers and the costs of saving and restoring SIMD contexts. That is exactly what splice and vmsplice do. They are often described as avoiding copying data between buffers, which is indeed correct, but more importantly, they completely bypass the conservative kernel code with extensive programs and scalar code.
