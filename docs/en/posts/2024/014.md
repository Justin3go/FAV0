**Parchment Style UI**

Recently, I have grown fond of the subtle yellow color used on the Perplexity and Claude websites. I remember enjoying novels in this style when I was younger, but I seem to have encountered it less as I grew older.

However, with the increasing frequency of using these two applications, I might have gotten used to it, and it feels increasingly comfortable to look at. It gives off a very knowledgeable vibe, akin to what Perplexity describes as "the starting point of knowledge." Moreover, the combination of this parchment style with serif fonts adds a unique flavor!

I see some friends using this subtle yellow style as their IDE theme. I tried it but still couldn't accept it, perhaps it's a matter of habit; I currently prefer the light silver-grey theme.
