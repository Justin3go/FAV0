[**Ban on Children Accessing Social Media**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/australia-proposes-ban-social-media-those-under-16-2024-11-06/)

Recently, I came across a news piece proposing a ban on social media access for children under 16 in Australia. First, I would like to share my thoughts. I am relatively supportive of this idea, and now I will explain my reasons:

The key issue is that social media has become a space driven by interests, making it difficult to determine whether the opinions shared are genuine attempts to educate or merely “provocative statements” meant to generate traffic. Personally, I feel that more extreme views tend to attract clicks, leading people to express their viewpoints, whether in agreement or opposition, which ultimately brings the content creator traffic and thus revenue.

Children, having less life experience and potentially lacking critical thinking skills, can easily become absorbed in the extreme views present in social media, which may lead them astray. Additionally, the current social media landscape is saturated with marginally inappropriate content, violence, etc. While these platforms do have some level of oversight, it does not seem particularly strict.

However, if social media is banned, where will children derive their judgment, values, and worldview from? Naturally, it will come from the real individuals around them, such as parents, teachers, and other genuinely caring people, rather than from a screen on social media or even from AI.

> Personal branding is indeed a wonderful concept. Recently, I've noticed a clear trend among many young academics, both domestic and international, starting to develop their personal brands.
> 
> Previously, the "competition" revolved around matters like how to butter up leaders and maintain collegial relationships. Now, individuals can openly build their brands, use personal IP to secure resources, attract students and collaborators, and promote their research.
> 
> They no longer just immerse themselves in research but also maximize their unique expression, showcasing their research and life.
> 
> This not only allows more people to see the value of their research but also grants them a stronger voice in the arena of “capturing quality talent.”
> 
> Ultimately, the rise of personal branding signifies a shift in academia, allowing young scholars to pursue their voice and influence with more boldness and confidence.

So, independent developers, go ahead and build your brands openly, using personal IP to secure resources and attract collaborators.
