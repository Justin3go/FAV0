# Issue 019 - Let's Talk About Open Source

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/fav0-019-cover.jpg)

Just a simple long exposure, feel the smoothness~

> This weekly publication on [Open Source](https://github.com/Justin3go/FAV0) records what I see and hear weekly, primarily focusing on front-end, AI, indie development, open source tools, etc. It is released every Saturday/weekend. Contributions are welcome, and I look forward to your [follow/subscription](https://fav0.com/feed.xml) -- [fav0.com](https://fav0.com/)
## \>\> Topics to Discuss

**Let's Talk About Open Source**

Recently, Linus removed the Maintainer permissions for Russian individuals from the Linux repository for certain reasons, leading many to complain that open source is no longer pure.

In fact, this is somewhat similar to the relationship between ethics and law. As an individual, Linus is the owner of the repository; since he has the authority to remove others' access, and since this action can exist, it can naturally be exercised, subject to only some condemnation at most.

However, part of open source is that the code is genuinely completely open source. You can use it based on its licenses, for example, by copying it. If this collective does not welcome you, you can completely fork this repository and form your own team to manage it, as the fork operation undeniably exists and is reasonable.

Additional thoughts:

We cannot completely demand that if someone opens up their work, they must adhere to the ideals of open source (as you may wish). After all, open source is just an action, and there are no rules requiring how they should proceed. Whether open source is for promotion or commercialization is entirely normal. Of course, if someone is genuinely passionate about open sourcing and actively maintains it or contributes to the community, we should cherish that rather than standing on a high ground demanding everyone to be selflessly dedicated.

> Some reasons include: The Linux Foundation, as a registered entity in the United States, must comply with U.S. export bans. If they discover that there are employees or contractors who are Russian or Russian entities, they can only terminate contracts. In other words, the Linux Foundation must sever its collaboration with these individuals.

### [Claude 3.5 Update](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use)

Since its release around June, Claude 3.5 Sonnet has been the most frequently used large language model among many developers, praised for its programming understanding capabilities.

Now, it has been updated!

The updated [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) shows wide improvements in industry benchmarks, particularly making significant advancements in autonomous coding and tool usage tasks. In coding, its performance in [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.swebench.com/) has risen from 33.4% to 49.0%, outperforming all publicly available models—including reasoning models like OpenAI's o1-preview and systems designed specifically for autonomous coding.

In summary, developers are right to use it.

You’ll be able to write more consistent and intuitive code, and there will be less to learn for newcomers to the framework.

It is also backward compatible, allowing for seamless upgrades! (Shout out to a previous colleague)

### [Automation Solutions Based on LLMs and Computer Vision](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/Skyvern)

Crawlers and anti-crawlers are really in a constant race!

When crawling data, if you can uncover how API interfaces are called and then simulate requests, that would be the most convenient method. If that doesn't work, you can also directly simulate user operations through Selenium or Puppeteer; this step is practically a catch-all.

Now, a new automation solution based on LLMs and computer vision has come out, replacing the previously manual processes!

## \>\> Interesting Finds

### AI's Understanding of "FAV0 Weekly"

Recently, I asked AI about its understanding of "FAV," and I was genuinely shocked—it completely exceeded my own thoughts. Originally, it was meant to represent "favorite" by taking the first three letters, but AI understood it as:

- "F" stands for "Front-end"
- "A" stands for "AI"
- "V" stands for "Various" (various types of content)

Well! Very nice~

### [Why I'm Skeptical of Rewriting JavaScript Tools in "Faster" Languages](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/)

These tools don't necessarily become faster just because a faster language is used. They might simply be:

1) Performance was considered during development.
2) The API interfaces are already defined, so the author doesn’t need to spend development time refining the overall design.

In fact, you might not even need to write tests! You can simply use the existing test suites from previous tools.

The reason rewrites are usually faster is merely that it is a rewrite—by the second time, you know more and focus more on performance, etc.
