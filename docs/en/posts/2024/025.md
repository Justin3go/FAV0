**Templates More Essential in the AI Era**

Whether it's Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot, AI coding has become more and more seamless. However, those who have used these tools know that having AI code a decent application from scratch is quite challenging. Compared to starting from scratch, AI is extremely good at mimicking existing templates. You provide a template, ask it to make tweaks, and it quickly produces an application you're satisfied with.

I truly believe the statement above, which is why my recent website was developed using templates plus AI. I used [Mkdirs](https://mkdirs.com/?via=t0) (a paid navigator template) + Copilot to develop a navigation site featuring 500+ free web templates: [Template0](https://template0.com/).

Some contrasting views:

> How could I possibly think the opposite? Templates are fixed, AI is dynamic. With the advent of AI, the traffic to template sites should decline, as people no longer need to look for templates to kick-start; instead, they can directly have AI generate something more tailored to their needs.

In my perspective, AI still struggles with generating comprehensive, systematic websites; whereas, customizing a template requires a certain level of ease for those who don't develop or are not familiar with that technological stack. Combining AI coding with template usage provides a perfect complement. Launching a website like the one mentioned above is swift, something I have experienced firsthand. AI's completions and edits are relatively usable.

This can also be reflected in the prompts we write for AI assistants. Giving an example is one of the important techniques frequently used to improve the accuracy of AI (LLM) Chat responses.

Let me briefly introduce the website I developed, which can help you quickly find the templates you want:

- Contains preview images of the homepage, and most details include long or multiple screenshots
- Categorized by usage, such as product landing pages, blogs, resumes, personal homepages, admin dashboards, services, business websites, etc.
- Tags for the technological stack used, allowing you to quickly find your familiar tech stack
- Personally selected some favorite templates

In addition, you can also submit your free templates to get permanent backlinks to enhance your SEO.

**Pricing Strategy**

> Pricing strategy is a part that many indie developers often ponder about. Here's a simple discussion of my strategies and thoughts.

Collecting the data for this website also required a considerable amount of time and effort, and maintaining it over the long term demands financial support. Therefore, I considered sponsorship for monetization. I believe my pricing strategy is quite reasonable and allows for a smooth transition past the initial phase of limited traffic, which indie developers can consider:

First, let me state that this site does not make money on templates themselves, so you can happily search for your desired templates without any commercial content. The site's profits come solely from sponsorships, meaning top-of-page sponsorships on the homepage and category pages to cover server hosting, domain, CMS, and manpower costs.

To ensure equal exposure for all brands and not affect the normal user experience, template0 has carefully limited the maximum display positions to 8. If there are more than 8 sponsors:

- They will be sorted according to the sponsorship amount per month, with a maximum of $99.
- If the sponsorship amount is the same, we will sort by the earliest sponsorship time.

As [template0.com](https://template0.com/) is still in the very early stages, now you can get the most prominent, niche developer traffic for as little as $1.

**Try Not to Cross Boundaries**

This weekly journal covers the content of two weeks because I found an excuse for myself last week and delayed it. So, try not to cross the boundaries; once it happens, it will occur multiple times.

### Is It Worth Dying at 23 with a Debt of 100,000?

An interesting answer goes like this:

Think of it this way: you are a corpse, and paying 100,000 allows you to start a vibrant life at 23. Would you buy it?

Indeed, many times, thinking from a different angle makes things clearer.
