# Issue 015 -- Regrets of Travel

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/DSC01820.jpg)

After taking this long exposure shot, the travel group I was with left without me noticing; I actually liked it at that moment. Looking back, it turned out to be shaky (I was shooting on a bridge, and it must have been caused by someone passing by), so the photo was wasted, which somewhat corresponds with this issue's theme.

**The regrets of travel are meant to make you want to travel again**

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, I joined a small group of friends to explore the Sichuan-Western Loop. This was my first time reaching a mid-high altitude as a resident of the basin, and I felt fine without any adverse reactions. The road to western Sichuan was a bit bumpy, and it felt as if my soul might fly away. Fortunately, I had been trained not to get motion sickness, or else it would have been an incredibly uncomfortable trip.

Overall, the three-day journey was quite pleasant, but the biggest drawback was the unpredictable weather. Unfortunately, we had bad luck and mostly saw snow-capped mountains shrouded in clouds and mist. Particularly when we went to Yuzixi, we were delayed by almost an hour due to traffic, causing us to miss the golden mountain at sunset. That evening, I saw videos from others who had captured the moment on Douyin [silent here].

Then my friend said: It's normal to have regrets when traveling; it just makes you want to return next time.

Congratulations to the Chinese badminton team for winning (4/5) championships at the China Open. It's a pity for the men's doubles, but they fought till the end despite injuries. The men's singles title [the weeble] should be, if I'm not mistaken, the first time since Chen Long in 2017 that the Chinese team has won at the China Open!

## \>\> Worth Reading 

### [GitHub sending phishing emails?](https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/)

In this article, the author encountered a type of malicious attack aimed at GitHub notification emails.

The attacker created a temporary GitHub account, quickly making and deleting an issue to lure the author into clicking a link in the email, ultimately leading to system infection by malware.

The content of the email was controlled by the attacker, lacking sufficient contextual information, which could mislead the recipient, so I usually click the [view it on github] link in the blue area below to check the background information in detail.

### [2024: 0.5% of the world's top 200 websites use valid HTML](https://meiert.com/en/blog/html-conformance-2024/)

Although HTML is simple, some problems can be easily overlooked. This article points out that 199 of the 200 most popular websites use flawed, non-existent, and/or malfunctioning HTML.

For example:

1. An `img` element must have an `alt` attribute unless under certain specific conditions.
2. The value `true` for the `async` attribute on the `script` element is invalid.
3. There’s no `li` element in the scope, yet an `li` ending tag is found.
4. The value `tel: 111` for the `href` attribute on the `a` element is illegal: there are illegal characters in the scheme data: spaces are not allowed.
5. The `head` element is missing required child element `title`.

And so on...

### [Discussing Future Technology Trends](https://tw93.fun/2024-09-09/future.html)

One particular explanation of blockchain-related technical terms left a strong impression on me:
