**Big Money vs. Small Money**

Recently I came across a saying that some people today are very entangled with small money, being "penny-pinching," which makes life feel quite burdensome. However, ordinary people often can't accumulate wealth, and this doesn't usually relate to those small amounts of money, but rather to the use of big money, such as investing, buying things, starting a business, or being scammed, etc. At that moment, they tend to be surprisingly "generous."

Here I’d like to discuss my spending habits briefly. Currently, most of my money is stored in Alipay and WeChat, categorized into my big money and small money:

- Big money in Alipay: My asset structure is quite simple. I keep part in Yu'ebao for emergency funds and invest part into index funds for some returns to hedge against inflation.
- Small money in WeChat: I give myself a small allowance each month as a budget for the month (food, leisure, sports, etc.), generally considering expenditures under 100 yuan as coming from WeChat Pay.

This mindset stems from my habit of checking my savings frequently, but I only look at the big money in Alipay. So, when the big money decreases, it really does hurt a bit; whereas, I don't really care much about the small money in WeChat.

How does big money decrease? Generally, significant expenses are mostly processed through Alipay, such as purchasing servers, cameras, or lenses, and I also draw from big money for my small monthly allowance. This way, tracking expenses becomes straightforward; I just need to focus on the expenditures in Alipay, while not needing to invest much mental effort on WeChat spending.

It's a simple principle: big money requires more attention, yet many people seem to have it backward for some reason.

### [This Team Forked Flutter to Create Flock](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/)

In this article, the author discusses the labor shortage faced by the Flutter team, leading to significant inadequacies in developer support. As the team size has failed to keep pace with the exploding user base of Flutter, the author argues for the necessity of creating a Flutter fork named Flock to accelerate development and optimize community contribution processes.

Flock will maintain synchronization with Flutter while introducing essential bug fixes and community features. The author emphasizes that Flock aims to enhance community engagement and efficiency through faster code reviews and friendlier contribution policies, rather than positioning itself against the Flutter community. Ultimately, the author calls for everyone to actively participate in the establishment of Flock to realize Flutter's complete potential.

**Key Points:**

- There is a serious imbalance between the number of Flutter team members and developers.
- Creating Flock will accelerate development and optimize contribution processes.
- Encourages community involvement to propel Flutter's growth through Flock.

### [Writing Code That's Easy to Delete but Hard to Extend](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)

1. **Avoid Writing Code**: Less code equals lower maintenance costs; strive to avoid unnecessary code.
2. **Moderate Copying and Pasting**: When reusability of code is uncertain, reduce complexity through copying and pasting.
3. **Avoid Excessive Copying and Pasting**: When a piece of code is repeated several times, consider extracting it into a function.
4. **Write More Boilerplate Code**: Reduce dependencies by writing boilerplate code, but keep readability in mind.
5. **Stop Writing Boilerplate Code**: Create simpler APIs to hide complexity.
6. **Chunk Code**: Break code into independent modules for easier management and deletion.
7. **Keep Writing Code**: Maintain code flexibility, using feature flags to enable quick adjustments when needed.
